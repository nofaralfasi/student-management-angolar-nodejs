# student-management-angular-nodejs

## Solution Description
1.	Client Side – I have used the angular framework.
The components I used for my solution are: student-list, student-add, home (for routing), and the student-details (extra – to display student details in a separate window).
I used a pipe filter for the searching box option, and I used the students-service for handling the http requests on the client.
2.	Server Side – I have used a simple Node.js server with the Express framework.

## Instructions
In order to run the project you need to run “npm install” on the root directory, and then run “npm start” in that directory (the dist folder is all set, so there is no need to build the angular project – but if you want to rebuild it just run “npm install” from the client directory and then run “ng build”). Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8888 where the app is all set and running.
